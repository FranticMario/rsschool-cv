__About me :__  I have been living in Germany for 6 years, where I work and study in the field of "construction information technology". My job is not related to programming or computers, but rather the opposite - I work in a factory. However, a week ago, I realized that I no longer want to live this way and want to learn something that has always interested me, but for which I had not taken any action. I am very serious about this and ready to devote a large part of my time to learning at RS School. Even if I am not able to pass the course on the first try, it will not discourage me, but rather motivate me to work harder on myself.
In university, we worked on website development (HTML, CSS) and optimization (JS), which I successfully passed, and we also studied Java, MySQL, and Python. I am very interested in learning something new every day, delving into it, and enjoying every day spent studying. Unfortunately, I discovered this wonderful RS School too late; before that, I was self-studying on the MDN website.

__Skills:__  Basic level of HTML, CSS, and JS, MySQL, some Java.
---

__Code example :__ Code example: I came across this problem when I was self-studying JS. Basically, I had to check a string for being an "isogram".
           ```

            function isIsogram(str) {
            var lowerCaseStr = str.toLowerCase();
            var charArray = lowerCaseStr.split("");
            for (var i = 0; i < charArray.length; i++) {
                if (charArray.indexOf(charArray[i]) !== i) {
                return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
            }

            ```
